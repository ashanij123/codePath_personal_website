        <p class="section2">
            Hello again! My name is Leonel Rivera-Castro and I am a current Codepath x Workday student intern, pursing a career in web development. Two fun facts about me is that I am an aries and I have a dog named Cookie. I currently attend UC Berkeley, with a major in Data Science. As stated before, I am from Hayward, California, which is pretty close to school's location. You might caught me hiking around some local trails as I love nature and getting outside. When I am not outside, sometimes when I am, I like to listen to The Weeknd, Drake and Reggaeton artist, like Bad Bunny. Additionally, I like video games.
